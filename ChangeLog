	* relay-bot.config: Fixed small issue in example config file

2006-03-19 08:39  freiheit

	* BUGS, relay-bot.pl: Prepping for update to a new release

2005-03-18 12:48  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Slight simplification of the 376/422 code issue.

2005-03-18 12:36  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Added support for "no motd" in addition to current
	  "end of motd".

2004-06-04 16:28  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Second try at allowing more characters in nicks.

2004-06-02 23:20  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: - Changed to allow relaying privmsgs to users with
	  unusual (but legal)	characters in their nicks.

2003-05-11 17:29  freiheit

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Made sleep time configurable.

2003-03-22 13:59  freiheit

	* relay-bot.config: Added a few comments to the config.

2002-11-02 09:30  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Reworked logging.  Logging now
	  works when daemon mode invoked.  Added option to disable output
	  buffering for logfile.  Added interrupt signal handler to close
	  the log file.  STDERR is now redirected to the log file.

2002-10-26 11:38  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Reworked the 'join' and 'part'
	  commands to be compatible with relay groups.	Specification of
	  channel AND network to join or part remains the same. However, if
	  you pass only a single argument 'join' or 'part' it is assumed to
	  be a relay group and, if valid, all of the channels in the group
	  will be join'ed or part'ed.

	  Also added an 'add' command which allow a channel to be added to
	  an existing relay group, or if the specified relay group doesn't
	  exist, a new one is created.	Syntax for this is:

	  /add #channel net group rcv xmit password

	  These arguments correspond to the elements in the %Relays
	  structure in the config file.  The last three arguments are
	  optional in the sense that if they are unspecified, default
	  values of 1, 1, and '' will be assumed.  However, to specify a
	  password, for example, rcv and xmit must be specified.

	  Once a channel has been added to a group, it is not automatically
	  'join'ed.  It is merely eligible to be 'join'ed the next time a
	  'join' request is issued to that channel or group.

2002-10-24 15:45  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Added separate config items for
	  echo-announcing topic changes and/or actually setting topic in
	  echo channels.

2002-10-23 20:02  wepprop

	* relay-bot.pl: Relay group functionality added to the remaining
	  handlers.

2002-10-23 13:12  wepprop

	* relay-bot.pl: 1)  Fixed oops that broke reverse compatibility for
	  config files containing $nick.  2)  Fixed bug in on_disconnect
	  resulting from misinterpretation of an obscure block of code that
	  I eventually figured out was there to provide reverse
	  compatibility with much earlier versions of the config file.	I
	  attempted to restore that functionality, but did not test it to
	  any degree.  It should be noted that attempting to provide
	  reverse compatibility with every previous versions is what made
	  Windows what it is today.

2002-10-22 17:49  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: $nick has been assimilated.

2002-10-21 20:48  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Full relay group functionality
	  has been implemented for topic changes *only*.

2002-10-21 10:45  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Changed %config handling so that it can
	  intelligently deal with an individual config item not being set,
	  instead of with the %config hash existing or not existing.

2002-10-20 13:55  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Beginning the implementation of
	  relay groups.  No change in functionality in these changes, only
	  the addition of the %Relays structure to the config file, and the
	  associated changes to the execution script.  If %hosts is defined
	  instead, data from it and $relay_channels are used to create a
	  %Relays structure.  In the new %Relays structure, the
	  functionality associated with the group, xmit, and rcv elements
	  is not yet implemented.

2002-10-17 17:29  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Formal logfile specification, for
	  those who prefer that over redirection.  Default behavior is to
	  write to standard out.

2002-10-16 15:03  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Added auto-ops list, fixed typo
	  on '$nick' specification.

2002-10-15 17:15  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Moved the checks for the "echo_" config items
	  (except the on_join which also handles ops) down to the spot
	  where the subroutines are bound to Net::IRC; more efficient to
	  simply not call the subroutine at all if you don't want to use
	  it, than to check at the beginning of the subroutine if it should
	  run.

2002-10-15 17:05  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Rewrote a bit to be more "perlish" and a tad easier
	  to read, but compiles identically.

2002-10-14 21:41  wepprop

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Collapsed individual config
	  options into monolithic hashes.

2002-10-14 10:49  freiheit

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: Patch from wepprop to add daemon
	  (run in background) capability.  It uses the Proc::Daemon module,
	  but "require"'s it rather than "use"'s it, so that people who
	  don't intend to use daemon mode aren't required to install the
	  package.

2002-10-14 10:41  freiheit

	* relay-bot.sh: Example little shell script I had laying around;
	  command-line options from wepprop are probably better for much of
	  this.

2002-10-13 00:41  freiheit

	* relay-bot.config, relay-bot.pl: per-function config and
	  command-line options from wepprop (disable or enable acting on
	  channel joins, parts, topic changes, etc...)

2002-10-07 21:15  freiheit

	* relay-bot.config: Better examples of what can be done...

2002-07-18 10:06  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Check if array is even in the hash before trying to
	  use hash; avoids death on topic change and other problems.

2002-07-18 08:25  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Cross-channel relaying expanded to include more
	  than simple public_msg.

2002-07-18 08:13  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Added cross-channel relaying.

2002-07-18 08:08  freiheit

	  Mmmm...

2002-07-04 12:29  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Smarter about disconnects and commented out
	  LocalAddr that we needed on that one box...

2002-07-04 12:25  freiheit

	* README, TODO: Documentation updates.	(Still terrible, but a bit
	  improved)

2001-08-17 17:15  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Changes to support multiple servers per network.
	  At startup will connect to them in order until it succeeds; when
	  disconnected, it will randomly try one of the servers defined for
	  that network.  In %hosts, just have an anonymous array containing
	  scalars instead of a scalar.	(still works fine with just a
	  scalar)

2001-07-13 15:56  freiheit

	* TODO: List of things to do...

2001-07-13 15:56  freiheit

	* relay-bot.config: comment out most of the auth lines so they're
	  examples, not "real".

2001-07-03 23:26  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Silent about unknown commands

2001-06-27 15:58  freiheit

	  during startup to figure out what takes so fucking long.

	  separate config file...

2001-06-08 15:25  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: whitespace cleanup

2001-06-07 12:26  freiheit

	* relay-bot.pl: Rearranged a little so "config" code is near the
	  top.

2000-12-29 16:49  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Changes to support specific network relaying

2000-12-29 16:32  eric

2000-12-10 23:39  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: A bunch of changes from Devin that need to be
	  committed.  Should be moving this to SourceForge soon, so he can
	  do it himself.

2000-11-27 22:56  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Various Devin changes...  (like notification of
	  signons and signoffs)

2000-11-27 22:55  eric

	  exactly...

2000-11-16 17:15  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Added ID line.

2000-11-16 17:14  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Various changes.

2000-10-23 17:09  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Multiple channels, another server, etc.

2000-10-23 16:18  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: It knows what it's doing, now...

2000-10-22 16:58  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Now it can easily be expanded to work with lots of
	  nets.

2000-10-22 16:50  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Discovered that I can detect which handle I've
	  got...  :-)

2000-10-22 16:05  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Actually works and stuff, even...

2000-10-22 15:51  eric

	* relay-bot.pl: Hopefully there's a remote chance that it'll
	  connect in two places and relay stuff between...
