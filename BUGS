- relay-bot is insufficiently stubborn about staying connected to an IRC
  server

- relay-bot can sometimes actually die from disconnects.  I suggest running
  it in a loop like "while sleep 1 ; do perl -w relay-bot.pl; sleep 60;
  done"

- Only a single server for a given network can be specified.  Would be
  better if a list could be specified and either be used cyclically on
  disconnect, or randomly chosen.
