REASON

Relay-bot is a program we initially wrote because our group of friends that
hang out on one channel could never seem to all stay on EFnet, and even if
we could EFnet was splitting so badly at the time that it was unusable. 
However, we couldn't readily switch to another network because not everybody
is always online and a few people wanted to stick with EFnet because there
were other friends of theirs still there.  So, relay-bot was born.  It
allowed us to split our channel across 2 (actually, 3 or 4) different IRC
networks fairly effectively.


INSTALL

Relay-bot is written in Perl, so you'll need a reasonably recent copy of
Perl.  You'll also need a copy of Net::IRC.

There's currently no real installation routine; just untar the tarball, edit
"relay-bot.config" and run "relay-bot.pl".
